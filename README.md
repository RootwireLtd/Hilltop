# Hilltop
Oversee your kingdom from Hilltop

This project's goal is to provide a series of API endpoints for receiving POST requests from other tools related to CyberEssentials assessment criteria. The project is expected to expand to fit other needs of your business and provide an aggregation point for a high-level overview of the health of your business.

Visualisation and reporting on the data are outside of the scope of the projects primary codebase at this time, and are instead provided by 3rd party open source solutions such as Grafana.

Outside of the API codebase, the following types of files are also in scope of the project repository, but only for ancilliary and exemplary purposes. This list is non-exhaustive, and we are very open to ideas, discussions, and contributions.

- Grafana Dashboards
- Docker Compose Files
- Helm Charts
